Alright, this isn't much, just small projects done with JavaScript for practice. 
Each project will be in its own folder and will have a text file explaining what it does. 
It's nothing fancy, but it's good for beginner practice. 
Plus, I'd rather not keep everything on a USB drive, in case I lose it or need to use one and have to delete the projects. 
So, I'm leaving them here on my GitHub.
:P bleeehhh
